       "I want to double and triple down on how vile candy corn is. I think of them as /wax teeth/. The first one I ever tasted was in second grade and it caused me to vomit in the hallway as I was running to the bathroom. It's like biting a poison candle. Also just regular marshmallows are as bad as marshmallow peeps or any other shape you press them into and leave them to get stale in. Every stage in the life of a marshmallow is disgusting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",

       "You misspelled TOBLERONE (you misspelled it last year, too). You have the B and L in the wrong order. Also, what does \"Gummy Bears straight up\" mean?

       "I grew up poor, but even still I HATED it when people gave out money to trick-or-treaters.  All I wanted was the candy!  I never understood why so many people liked getting pennies and nickels.  Maybe if we grew up in the 1950's, when a nickel could still buy you something, that would make sense. By the time i was growing up in the 90's any denomination of currency less than a quarter was pretty much useless for buying things.  Hell, most candy bars cost at least a dollar, even back then.

Everything else is just bag fodder that you can sometimes trick your little sister into trading for something decent.  My sister used to infuriate me - as a male, of course all my candy would be gone in a matter of hours or at most a couple of days.  Meanwhile, my sister had been carefully rationing her stash, eating one piece a day. She would then torture me by providing swooning critiques of whatever candy she was eating in front of me on any given day. The torture would last for weeks.  The payoff (for her) was when I would finally break down blubbering on the floor begging her to please - oh please - share her bounty with her poor starving brother.

       "The moment I realized you expected me to evaluate what might be over 100 items I stopped. Follow this link to see a better approach to evaluating a large list of items: http://walthickey.com/2017/10/18/whats-the-best-halloween-candy/  It's essentially random pairwise comparison. Allourideas.org provides a similar platform but allows users too add their own items.

       "I had to Ecosia search (\"Google\") so many of these candies. They are not at my local Dollarama. They aren't even at my non-local Dollarama. You can get full sized bars for $0.77 sometimes (Why did they take away the symbol for 'cent'? Ugh.) Also, can I still make surveys like these even after graduating from UBC?

       "Being Dutch I feel inclined to defend the virtueus if Licorice (yes black)/Liquorish/Drop. This stuff can geographically be found over here (anywhere western of Poland and Northern of Paris, France - including the UK and Scandinavia), in either salty or sweet varieties. Outside of this Geo-stratum you'd have a hard time finding quality drop.  Anywhere else it's just your American generic \"Haribo\" fake-ass \"drop\".  And for the last time: Red Liquorish is NOT drop.  Drop is to black liquorish as opium is to aspirin: very very weak. They have nothing to do with each other.  Admittedly, drop is an acquired taste, so I'd admit black liquorish may be called gateway drop. You know, for kids. (Not saying Dutch kids won't devour mouthfulls of the tar-black stuff, given half a chance. But then again, I've seen wine-drunk toddlers at camp-sites in France...)

       "Tastes are so individualized!  As I've gotten older (and manage to keep my economic head above water) I've begun to eschew most commercial candy.  I've also grown more attracted to stronger flavors.  Darker chocolates, more bitter/saltier licorices, balances of sweet and savory... this is what I want.  On my \"mostly don't care\" list are most fruit candies.  They all taste fake to me.

       "When I was a kid, and lived in a Midwestern town of about 1100, Halloween was awe.some. I had 2 older sisters, and Mom would drop us off in town (we lived about a mile out) at dusk and tell us to meet at Grandma's (in town) at a certain time. Then we were turnt loose. Sisters always caught up with their older friends, and I made the rounds with mine. The streets were filled with kids, and no cars were out because everyone was home to greet the trick-r-treaters, except the local hoods TP-ing houses or rolling metal trashcans down the hill from the railroad tracks until it crashed into a parked car. Kids probably age 8-12 or so absolutely ruled the night. I ended up with a grocery bag of goods, and on the way home we always stopped at our neighbor's house, the widow Mrs. Strickler, who had been a teacher at the local high school until she retired in the 70s. She did not get many visitors, mostly people she knew and their kids, so she always had an amazing assortment: at least 2 full-size candy bars (Clark was a favorite) and *always* a caramel popcorn ball. Most years the elementary school hosted a Halloween Festival in the gymnasium, with a costume contest, ring toss, \"teacher jail\" (where you would pay a little money to put a teacher in a cardboard box painted to look like a jail cell, for 15 minutes or whatever), a haunted house in the locker room, and all proceeds went to I think the Lion's Club. One year when i was very young, I went as a paper sack of groceries. I was small enough Mom could cut arm and leg holes, and it was held up by suspenders that broke so I had to hold the bottom all night. I was carrying myself! Then Mom put boxes of stuff in with me. Well, I did not do much Halloween stuff in high school, except horror movies. I was too old/cool for trick-r-treating and not really into partying or vandalism or whatever (at least not that night ell oh ell). Of course by the time got to college ... well those are stories for another time.    1\n",

       "Does the \"Going trick-or-treating\" question mean that you, yourself plan to obtain candy from neighbors or that you are taking your children going. In the latter case, it is guaranteed that you will ration out their candy (for health) and encourage sharing (for you); i.e., your opinions matter. In the former case, as a douchey hipster who is perfectly capable of buying their own stupid candy, circus peanuts and individual, unbagged slices (including ends) of oat nut bread are all you deserve in life, and why is anyone asking what you think?

       "Candy stuff is serious business and one should take care in making selections. I applaud your efforts to list things that aren't actually candy, but think of the consequences of your actions. Candy companies could be looking at this and think they no longer need to give a shit. We can't have that. Halloween is the season opener, followed closely by Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years. Of course, it's tough to beat Valentine's Day. Get rid of the chocolate shit and go down on a cherry sour lollipop. The heart shaped ones that are kinda flat, so they just lay in your mouth melting. Ahhhh...   (and bonus! They're sour!) Then we have Mother's Day which of course, is chocolate top-heavy. Easter doesn't suck but it's still chocalate-heavy. And it's that gross, waxy chocolate. (Stab me, please) Major bonus is the current jelly bean wars. This past Easter, there were probably a dozen different flavors. I could have basked in that month forever. Another Easter bonus is that you get a basket to put your shit in. I guess you could say that about Halloween, but let's face it, those plastic pumpkin shaped \"baskets\" are really not worthy. Father's Day is completely ignored by the candy industry and this really needs to be looked at. Father's Day is the biggest travesty because it's the last candy holiday of the year.

       "I don't *love* chocolate unless it is accompanied with something nutty/crunchy and I prefer to get gummy candy, but that's not a big feature of Halloween. My go-to is gummy bears. Especially Haribo Gold Bears.   I am sometimes ashamed that I am an adult and I still consume a lot of candy (and spend a lot of time thinking about candy). Like I am sure I eat/think about candy way more than other normal people who are my age.

       "I once got frustrated trying to unwrap a chocolate eyeball so I popped it in my mouth and chewed it up, foil and all. It was delicious. Yes, I have fillings. The point is that chocolate is always better, unless it's gone weird and old, and unless it's carob. Because giving a kid carob when they have reason to expect chocolate is just fucked up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
       "1960-70s - Traded all the boring candy (Lemonheads, Sourballs, Smarties, etc) to my brother for all the Reese's cups and Kit-kats.  1980-90s - Gave out candy at my suburban house.  Qualitative data over 14 years of personal anthropological data gathering:  1. dressing like a witch scared the littles away.  2. handfuls of Hershey's miniatures garnered the most \"thank you\"s and the most enthuiastic \"thank you\"s. .  3. Jolly Ranchers were not met with joy in about 3/4 of the kids. This surprised me. 4. 50/50 split on caramel & nuts (Snickers) vs just chcolate and nougat(MilkyWay) when kids were allowed to choose their own handful of miniatures from a bowl. Very few chose both.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",

Plus, they're really fun!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",
